# Limbic System Reset

These are notes about limbic system reset from my friend. She did the exercise below three times per day, every day, for three months. She cured herself of extensive allergies and food reactions.

## Step 1

"HUSH HUSH HUSH."

Step back.

Point to my head and say "My brain is stuck in a rut …"

Point to my heart and say "… and is sending my body false messages."

Lower my arms and hands down to my sides.


## Step 2

Move my arms and hands out to my left side and say "Overfiring of the limbic system …"

Move my arms and hands out to my right side, and say "… in the past caused a slew of unhelpful symptoms and led to unhelpful coping behaviors."


## Step 3

Step forward.

Point to my brain, and say "But I choose to rewire my brain, because I can, and it works."

Turn around, and say "Congratulations! This is an excellent choice and I'm so proud of you. I love you."


## Step 4

Turn toward limbic system.

"Thank you little limbic system for protecting us in every way you know how."

"You did a great job and I'm incredibly grateful! 

"And now you can relax."

"There's a warm sand beach and a hammock for you. You can just kick back and relax. I've got this now. There's a new program we are running now."

Point at the self, and say "What program do you choose?"

Step into the step X self.

Raise your arms and hands up, and say "I choose that I can depend on my body to be healthy. Full stop."

Step forward.

"And now I'm going to a time in when I'm having tea at my favorite cafe, and there's lots of people having nice conversations, and my friends are laughing, and we are happy and healthy, and we are eating and drinking together.""

Step forward into the future.

"And now I am going to a time where I am having fun outside with my friends. We are hiking in the sunshine, and we are relaxing at the beach, and we are swimming in the sea together. Everyone is giggling and there is a warm breeze. We are playing in the sea and joking. And afterward we head to our favorite restaurant to have food and drinks, and we pet all the dogs in the restaurant, we and tell fun stories. Then we all go to hear live music at the local bar, and we laugh and enjoy the all the songs together."
